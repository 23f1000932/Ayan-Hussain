👨‍💻 About Me
--------------
I am **Ayan Hussain**, currently pursuing a **BS in Data Science and Applications** at the prestigious **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras**.

I sit at the intersection of data analysis and software engineering. While my core academic focus is on extracting insights from complex datasets using Python and SQL, I have a deep passion for building the tools that make those insights accessible---ranging from full-stack web applications to predictive machine learning models.

-   **CGPA:** 7.9/10.0

-   **Focus Areas:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Full Stack Development, and Data Analytics.

🚀 My Journey
-------------

My journey into technology began with a curiosity about how data drives decision-making.

-   **The Foundation:** I started by mastering the basics of programming with **Python and Java**, quickly realizing that code is the most powerful tool for problem-solving.

-   **Data Science Immersion:** At IIT Madras, I dove deep into **Mathematics and Statistics**, learning how to manipulate data using **Pandas and NumPy**, and visualizing stories with **Matplotlib**.

-   **Machine Learning Era:** I progressed to building predictive models using **Scikit-Learn**. I didn't stop at traditional ML; I expanded into Deep Learning, building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from scratch using **TensorFlow and Keras**.

-   **Full Stack Integration:** Realizing that a model is only useful if people can interact with it, I learned web development. I started building scalable applications using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **Vue.js** for the frontend, integrating **SQL databases** to manage real-time data.

-   **Continuous Learning:** I actively participate in workshops and hackathons, recently completing the **Google AI Agents Intensive** and the **Applied Vibe Coding** challenge at IITM to stay on the bleeding edge of AI.

🟩 About This Website
---------------------

This portfolio is not just a template; it is a reflection of my "builder" mindset.

### Design Philosophy: "The Matrix"

I wanted a design that stood out from the sea of standard corporate portfolios. I chose a **Cyberpunk / Matrix-inspired aesthetic** featuring a high-contrast black and neon-green palette. It represents the terminal-based environment where data scientists and developers spend most of their time.

### How It Was Built (Under the Hood)

Unlike modern trends that rely heavily on bulky frameworks like React or styling libraries like Bootstrap/Tailwind, I challenged myself to build this using **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

-   **No Frameworks:** The site is lightweight and loads instantly because it relies on pure browser technologies.

-   **The Matrix Rain:** The falling code background isn't a video or a GIF. It is a custom **HTML5 Canvas** animation written in JavaScript that dynamically renders characters falling down the screen, adapting to your window size.

-   **Responsiveness:** I used CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts with media queries to ensure the site looks perfect on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

-   **Theme Engine:** The site features a robust Light/Dark mode toggle that persists your preference using the browser's `localStorage`.
